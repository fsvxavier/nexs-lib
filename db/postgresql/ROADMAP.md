### 4. Developer Experience (Medium Priority)
- [ ] CLI tool for provider selection and setup
- [ ] Configuration validation utilities
- [ ] Interactive examples and tutorials
- [ ] Performance tuning guides
- [ ] Migration guides between providers

### 5. Extensions & Plugins (Low Priority)
- [ ] SQLite provider for development/testing
- [ ] MySQL provider for multi-database support
- [ ] Query builder extensions
- [ ] Schema migration tools
- [ ] Database seeding utilities

### 6. Production Readiness (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Connection leak detection
- [ ] Automatic failover mechanisms
- [ ] Database connection monitoring
- [ ] Configuration hot-reloading
